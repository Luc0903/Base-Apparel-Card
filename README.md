### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - The `input` field is empty
  - The email address is not formatted correctly

## My process 

Every part of the design was quite easy to develop, the real problem began when the submit button logo, in SVG format, was not working probably. I probably spent at least 4 hours trying to solve it and the I just decided that I should have done it with another image.


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I should not be too bothered to use SVG images, especially if they are icons, I should search them in different websites.


### Continued development

It is necessary for me to start working more on icons and gradients, I’ve also lost practice with CSS Grid. I did not use JS in the end and it was a requirement.
